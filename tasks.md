## üö® Critical Issues

1. **No OpenAI API Key**: SmartScope can't function
2. **Registration Broken**: Missing user_type field
3. **No Data**: Most tables are empty
4. **No Error Boundaries**: App crashes on errors
5. **No Loading States**: Poor UX during API calls
6. **No Pagination**: Will fail with large datasets
7. **No File Upload**: Can't upload photos/documents
8. **No Real-Time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Stop Writing Specs**: Focus on building what's already specified
2. **Fix Core Flow**: Get registration ‚Üí property ‚Üí project working
3. **Add Test Data**: Populate database for development
4. **Implement MVP**: Don't build all features, build core path
5. **Add Monitoring**: Implement error tracking immediately
6. **Create Demo**: Build a working demo of core features
7. **User Testing**: Get feedback on existing features
8. **Simplify Scope**: Consider cutting features for MVP
