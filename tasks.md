## üö® Critical Issues

1. **No OpenAI API Key**: SmartScope can't function
2. **Registration Broken**: Missing user_type field
3. **No Data**: Most tables are empty
4. **No Error Boundaries**: App crashes on errors
5. **No Loading States**: Poor UX during API calls
6. **No Pagination**: Will fail with large datasets
7. **No File Upload**: Can't upload photos/documents
8. **No Real-Time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Stop Writing Specs**: Focus on building what's already specified
2. **Fix Core Flow**: Get registration ‚Üí property ‚Üí project working
3. **Add Test Data**: Populate database for development
4. **Implement MVP**: Don't build all features, build core path
5. **Add Monitoring**: Implement error tracking immediately
6. **Create Demo**: Build a working demo of core features
7. **User Testing**: Get feedback on existing features
8. **Simplify Scope**: Consider cutting features for MVP

# Current Build Audit

## ‚úÖ Implemented in the Repository Today
- Extensive documentation set (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `specs/**`) that captures product vision, feature specs, and implementation guides.
- Database migrations through `004_marketplace_core.sql` defining marketplace tables (projects, quotes, contractors, smartscope_analyses, etc.) plus the earlier property schemas.
- FastAPI application scaffolding with routers for authentication, properties, projects, and SmartScope along with corresponding Pydantic models and Supabase-backed services.
- SmartScope service layer, OpenAI Vision integration wrapper, and cost tracking helper stubs wired into the API (no concrete provider credentials supplied).
- Supabase service singleton and settings module that load environment configuration for backend usage (currently populated with placeholder keys that must be replaced).
- Next.js frontend scaffold with Auth context, authentication forms, and placeholder dashboard/property components.
- Initial automated test scaffolding under `api/tests/` covering auth flows, Supabase integration surface, and SmartScope service behavior.
- Developer tooling scripts for starting the API (`start_server.py`), running combined tests (`run_tests.py`), and lint/test configuration files for both API and web apps.

## üöß High-Priority Gaps & Follow-Up Tasks

### Platform & DevOps

1. ‚úÖ Config now loads secrets exclusively from environment variables, supporting local `.env` files and production secret managers with updated documentation.
1. Replace placeholder Supabase/AI credentials in `api/config.py` with secure environment management and document setup for local + production usage.

2. Provide infrastructure scripts or instructions for provisioning required storage buckets, Edge Functions, and webhook endpoints referenced in specs but absent from the repo.
3. Implement CI workflows (lint, tests, type-check) and ensure both API and web apps have reproducible dependency locks.

### Authentication & User Management
4. Finish email verification flow‚Äî`/verify-email` currently returns success without persisting any state or hitting Supabase verification endpoints.
5. Wire `/logout`, `/profile`, and password reset endpoints to real Supabase auth/session state instead of placeholders; add negative-path tests.
6. Ensure organization creation/association logic matches marketplace rules (role enforcement, invitations) and surface the flows in the frontend (only auth forms exist today).

### Property Management
7. Connect property components in `web/src/components/properties` to live API data, add create/edit flows, and render property metadata (currently just UI shells).
8. Implement property import/export, audit logging, and group membership management endpoints promised by the service layer but lacking routers/tests/frontends.
9. Add end-to-end tests (API + UI) verifying property CRUD, bulk operations, and authorization boundaries.

### Project Creation
10. Extend `ProjectService` to cover full spec requirements: media upload orchestration, invitation automation, SmartScope trigger hooks, and contractor-matching scoring.
11. Build Next.js project creation wizard, validation, and file upload experience; no frontend exists for projects today beyond placeholders.
12. Introduce background processing/queues for project lifecycle events (notifications, SmartScope requests) as called out in the specs.

### Contractor Onboarding
13. Implement contractor domain models, Supabase tables usage, and FastAPI routes‚Äîno onboarding backend or UI exists beyond SQL definitions.
14. Deliver contractor-facing Next.js flows (registration, credential upload, availability) and tie them to verification workflows.
15. Add compliance checks, document storage integration, and automated approval pipelines described in the onboarding specification.

### Quote Submission
16. Build ingestion services for PDF uploads, email processing, manual entry, and photo capture‚Äîonly database schema exists at present.
17. Implement quote standardization engine (OCR/NLP adapters, normalization rules, AI confidence scoring) and persist results.
18. Create property manager UI for quote comparison, evaluation, and award selection; no frontend or API endpoints currently cover these tasks.

### SmartScope AI
19. Provide actual OpenAI API key management, request throttling, and error fallbacks; existing code will raise without environment configuration.
20. Implement webhook/storage handling for photo ingestion and ensure SmartScope results post back into projects/notifications per spec.
21. Expand test coverage to include mocked OpenAI responses, cost tracking assertions, and Supabase persistence validation.

### Frontend Experience & Navigation
22. Build global layout, navigation, and routing guard logic connecting auth state to protected routes (dashboard is static today).
23. Implement project, property, contractor, and quote views/pages with real data fetching hooks and optimistic updates.
24. Add design system components, loading/error states, and responsiveness as described in UI guides‚Äîcurrent UI is minimal and unaudited.

### Testing, QA, and Tooling
25. Establish comprehensive pytest suites for every router/service plus contract tests for Supabase interactions; current coverage is sparse and lacks fixtures for new tables.
26. Add Playwright or Cypress end-to-end tests for critical user journeys (auth, property CRUD, project creation, quote review).
27. Integrate linting/formatting/type-check commands into both API (`ruff`, `mypy`) and web (`eslint`, `tsc`) pipelines and make sure they pass.

### Documentation & Tracking
28. Reconcile `PROGRESS.md`, migration trackers, and feature specs with the actual codebase so status reports no longer overstate completion.
29. Document local development workflows for running FastAPI + Next.js together, including required environment variables and mock services.
30. Maintain updated task breakdowns within each `specs/[feature]/tasks.md` reflecting real progress as features land.
