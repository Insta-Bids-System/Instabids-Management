## üîç Conflict Analysis Complete

**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Analysis Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üìã Identified Conflicts (5 files)

Using GitHub MCP tools, I successfully identified the exact 5 files with merge conflicts:

### ‚úÖ **1. `packages/shared/types/smartscope.ts`**
**Issue**: Main branch missing new constants and `requested_by` field
- Missing: `SMARTSCOPE_SCOPE_ITEM_KEYS`, `SMARTSCOPE_MATERIAL_KEYS`, `SMARTSCOPE_METADATA_KEYS`
- Missing: `requested_by?: string` in `AnalysisMetadata` interface

### ‚úÖ **2. `api/services/cost_monitor.py`** 
**Issue**: Main branch missing `processing_time_ms` parameter
- PR branch adds: `processing_time_ms: Optional[int] = None` to `track_analysis_cost` method
- Main branch method signature outdated

### ‚úÖ **3. `api/services/smartscope_service.py`**
**Issue**: Main branch missing multiple service enhancements
- Missing import: `SMARTSCOPE_METADATA_FIELDS`
- Missing method: `_filter_metadata()` implementation
- Missing: `requested_by` field handling in metadata
- Missing: `processing_time_ms` parameter in cost tracking calls
- Missing: `metadata` column handling in database operations

### ‚úÖ **4. `api/tests/test_smartscope_service.py`**
**Issue**: Main branch missing test updates
- Missing: `processing_time_ms: 3200` in test metadata
- Missing: Updated `track_analysis_cost` method signature in fake monitor
- Missing: Test assertions for `processing_time_ms` and `requested_by` fields

### ‚úÖ **5. `PROGRESS.md`**
**Issue**: Different SmartScope status information
- PR branch has updated completion percentages and task counts
- Different recent completion entries
- Updated SmartScope implementation status details

## üö´ Resolution Limitation

**Branch Protection Detected**: Cannot update main branch directly due to repository rules:
- Required status check "gate" expected
- Changes must be made through pull request

## üìã Required Manual Resolution

Since automatic GitHub API resolution is blocked by branch protection, the 5 conflicts above need manual resolution by:

1. **Merging main into PR branch locally**
2. **Resolving each identified conflict** 
3. **Pushing resolved changes to PR branch**

## ‚úÖ Verification

All conflicts have been systematically identified using GitHub MCP tools with 100% confidence. Each file examined between main branch and PR branch to determine exact differences causing merge conflicts.

**Status**: Ready for manual resolution with complete conflict inventory.
