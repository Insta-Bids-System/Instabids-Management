## ðŸ“Š Shared Database Tables

### Core Tables Used By Multiple Features
```sql
user_profiles       â†’ All 7 features
properties          â†’ Projects, Admin
projects            â†’ SmartScope, Quotes, Admin
contractors         â†’ Projects, Quotes, Admin  
quotes              â†’ Comparison, Admin
smartscope_analyses â†’ Projects, Quotes, Admin
invitations         â†’ Projects, Contractors, Admin
```

## ðŸ”Œ API Integration Matrix

| Feature | Consumes APIs From | Provides APIs To |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Authentication | - | All features |
| Properties | Auth | Projects, Admin |
| Projects | Auth, Properties, SmartScope | Contractors, Quotes, Admin |
| SmartScope | OpenAI Vision | Projects, Quotes |
| Contractors | Auth, Projects | Quotes, Admin |
| Quotes | Projects, Contractors | Comparison, Admin |
| Admin | All features | - |

## âœ… Enum Consistency Verified

All features use consistent enums:
- `user_type`: 'homeowner', 'contractor', 'admin', 'super_admin'
- `project_status`: 'draft', 'active', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled'
- `urgency_level`: 'emergency', 'urgent', 'routine'
- `quote_status`: 'draft', 'submitted', 'reviewed', 'accepted', 'rejected'
- `project_category`: Consistent across all features

## ðŸ”„ Real-Time Event Flow

```typescript
// Events emitted and consumed
ProjectCreated     â†’ SmartScope, Contractors, Admin
PhotosUploaded     â†’ SmartScope
AnalysisComplete   â†’ Projects, Contractors
ContractorInvited  â†’ Contractors, Admin
QuoteSubmitted     â†’ Projects, Admin
QuoteStandardized  â†’ Comparison, Admin
ProjectAwarded     â†’ Contractors, Quotes, Admin
```

## âœ… External System Integrations

### Working Together
1. **OpenAI Vision API** (SmartScope)
   - Used by: SmartScope AI
   - Affects: Project scopes shown to contractors

2. **SendGrid Email** (Multiple)
   - Used by: Auth, Invitations, Quotes
   - Unified email templates

3. **AWS S3** (Storage)
   - Used by: Properties, Projects, Quotes
   - Shared bucket structure

4. **External Contractor System**
   - Provides: New contractor leads
   - Consumes: Onboarding API
   - Integration: Webhook notifications

## ðŸš¨ Critical Dependencies Verified

### Must Work In Order
1. Auth â†’ User creation before anything
2. Properties â†’ Before project creation
3. Projects â†’ Before quotes/invitations
4. SmartScope â†’ Enhances but not blocks projects
5. Contractors â†’ Must exist before quotes

### Can Work In Parallel
- Property Management + Contractor Onboarding
- SmartScope Analysis + Invitation Sending
- Quote Submission + Admin Monitoring

## âœ… Security & Permissions Aligned

### RLS Policies Consistent
```sql
-- All tables use same user_id pattern
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data"
  ON [table_name]
  FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Admin override on all tables
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all"
  ON [table_name]
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
      AND user_type IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
    )
  );
```

## âœ… Testing Coverage Planned

### Integration Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Project Flow**
   - User registers â†’ Creates property â†’ Creates project â†’ AI analyzes â†’ Contractors invited â†’ Quotes submitted â†’ Comparison â†’ Award

2. **Contractor Journey**
   - Register â†’ Onboard â†’ Receive invitation â†’ View scope â†’ Submit quote â†’ Get awarded

3. **Admin Oversight**
   - Monitor all activity â†’ Review contractors â†’ Analyze metrics â†’ Export reports

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics Alignment

All features contribute to core metrics:
- **Project Creation Time**: < 2 minutes (Auth + Properties + Projects)
- **Quote Turnaround**: < 4 hours (Projects + SmartScope + Quotes)
- **Standardization Rate**: 85% (Quotes + SmartScope)
- **Contractor Response**: 70% (Contractors + Invitations)
- **Platform Efficiency**: 50% time saved (All features)

## âœ… Deployment Readiness

### Features Can Deploy Independently
- âœ… Each feature has own API router
- âœ… Database migrations are incremental
- âœ… Frontend components are modular
- âœ… Can feature-flag each feature

### Must Deploy Together
- User Authentication (foundation for all)
- Database migrations (in sequence)

## ðŸŸ¢ VERIFICATION RESULT: FULLY INTEGRATED

All 7 features are designed to work together as a complete system:
- âœ… Data models are consistent
- âœ… API contracts are defined
- âœ… Database relationships are proper
- âœ… Event flows are mapped
- âœ… Security is unified
- âœ… External systems integrated
- âœ… Testing strategy covers integration

The system is ready for parallel development by multiple Codex agents.
