# Future Supabase Alignment Notes

- Verified that the existing `quotes` schema (from `004_marketplace_core.sql`) already provides the fields required by the web-form submission API, including `contractor_id`, `standardized_data`, and pricing/timeline columns.
- Updated the application service layer to resolve `contractor_id` via the `contractors` table, matching the foreign key definition in Supabase; no database changes are required.
- No new migrations are necessary at this time. Add additional SQL files in this folder if future Supabase updates are needed.
# Future Migrations

This directory is for NEW database migrations created by agents.

## Naming Convention
- Use sequential numbers: 005_feature_name.sql, 006_another_feature.sql
- Keep names descriptive

## Before Creating a Migration
1. Check DATABASE_COMPLETE.md for current state
2. Review TABLES_DETAILED.md for existing columns
3. Ensure your changes don't conflict

## Migration Template
```sql
-- Migration XXX: Brief Description
-- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
-- Author: [Agent Name]

-- Your SQL changes here
```

## Important
- The documentation files in parent directory show CURRENT state
- Migrations here are for FUTURE changes only
- Always test migrations in development first
