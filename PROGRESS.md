### 📊 Feature Status

#### ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

**User Authentication**
```yaml
Spec: COMPLETED ✅
Plan: COMPLETED ✅  
Tasks: COMPLETED ✅
Backend: COMPLETED ✅ (9 endpoints fully working)
Frontend: COMPLETED ✅ (React forms with validation)
Database: COMPLETED ✅
Testing: COMPLETED ✅ (All endpoints tested)
Status: 95% Complete
```

**Property Management Foundation**
```yaml
Spec: COMPLETED ✅
Plan: COMPLETED ✅
Tasks: COMPLETED ✅
Backend: COMPLETED ✅ (14 endpoints working)
Frontend: PARTIAL ✅ (Basic CRUD working, missing advanced features)

Status: 42% Complete (64/153 tasks)
```

#### 🚧 MARKETPLACE FEATURES (NEW PRIORITY)

**Project Creation**
```yaml
Spec: COMPLETED ✅
Plan: COMPLETED ✅
Tasks: IN PROGRESS (Phase 1 groundwork only; 0/96 tasks verified complete)
Backend: IN PROGRESS (FastAPI CRUD endpoints and Supabase data access service)
Frontend: NOT STARTED (no wizard, upload UI, or client flows yet)
Database: PARTIAL (004 migration adds core tables; invitation/template automation outstanding)
Status: 15% Complete (basic CRUD available, rest of workflow unbuilt)
```

**Outstanding Focus Areas**
- Media upload pipeline (storage bucket, signed URLs, completion tracking)
- Project creation wizard UI and validation
- Contractor matching algorithm and scoring rules
- Invitation workflow and contractor notifications
- SmartScope integration triggers and result handling

**Contractor Onboarding**
```yaml
Spec: COMPLETED ✅
Plan: COMPLETED ✅
Tasks: COMPLETED ✅ (75 tasks)
Backend: NOT STARTED
Frontend: NOT STARTED
Database: NOT STARTED
Status: 30% Complete (Planning Done)
```

**Quote Submission**
```yaml
Spec: COMPLETED ✅
Plan: NOT COMPLETED
Tasks: COMPLETED ✅ (60+ tasks)
Backend: NOT STARTED
Frontend: NOT STARTED
Database: NOT STARTED
Status: 25% Complete (Planning Done)
```

**SmartScope AI**
```yaml
Spec: COMPLETED ✅
Plan: NOT COMPLETED
Tasks: IN PROGRESS (domain contracts shipped; schema alignment + automation still open)
Backend: IN PROGRESS (analysis + feedback endpoints working against fakes; Supabase persistence blocked by schema drift)
AI Integration: IN PROGRESS (vision service, preprocessing, prompting)
Database: IN PROGRESS (004 schema still uses arrays/missing costs table; 005 alignment migration not applied)
Status: 40% Complete (Core service logic exists, but database alignment, UI, and integrations remain outstanding)
```
