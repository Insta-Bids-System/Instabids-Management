```

## ‚úÖ **FEATURE STATUS: 80% COMPLETE**

### **What's Already Built:**
- ‚úÖ Database tables (properties, property_groups, property_group_members, property_audit_log)
- ‚úÖ Backend API (14 endpoints, full CRUD, import/export)
- ‚úÖ Property management business logic
- ‚úÖ Geocoding and mapping integration
- ‚úÖ Property grouping and organization

### **What's Remaining:**
- [ ] Frontend UI components (property list, detail pages)
- [ ] Property import/export interface
- [ ] Property search and filtering
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Connection**

**Supabase Configuration:**
```yaml
Project ID: lmbpvkfcfhdfaihigfdu
URL: https://lmbpvkfcfhdfaihigfdu.supabase.co
Environment: Development
```

**Property Management Tables (Already Created):**
- `properties` - Main property information with geocoding
- `property_groups` - Property organization and grouping
- `property_group_members` - Group membership relationships
- `property_audit_log` - Property change tracking
- `organizations` - Property ownership context

## üéØ **Your Mission: Complete Property Management Frontend**

### **Goal**
Build the remaining frontend components to complete the property management system, focusing on user interface and user experience.

### **Remaining Features to Build**
1. **Property List View** - Searchable, filterable property listing
2. **Property Detail Pages** - Comprehensive property information display
3. **Property Creation/Edit Forms** - User-friendly property management interface
4. **Import/Export Interface** - Bulk property operations
5. **Property Groups Management** - Group creation and member management
6. **Mobile-Responsive Design** - Optimized for mobile property managers

### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Complete the remaining 20% of tasks in `tasks.md`
- ‚úÖ Intuitive property management interface
- ‚úÖ Fast, responsive property search and filtering
- ‚úÖ Bulk import/export functionality working
- ‚úÖ Mobile-optimized design
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing backend API

## üîß **Development Guidelines**

### **Existing File Structure**
```
src/api/properties/                # Backend API endpoints (COMPLETE)
src/components/properties/         # Frontend components (NEEDS WORK)
tests/property-management/         # Test files (NEEDS COMPLETION)
```

### **Database Operations**
- **ALREADY WORKING** - All property tables and APIs are complete
- **USE EXISTING ENDPOINTS** - 14 backend endpoints are ready to use
- **NO SCHEMA CHANGES** - Focus on frontend development

### **Git Workflow**
```bash
# Work on feature branch
git checkout -b feature/property-frontend

# Focus on UI components and user experience
git commit -m "feat: implement property list view with search and filters"

# Update progress tracking
# Edit /PROGRESS.md when tasks are complete
```

### **Progress Tracking**
**ALWAYS update these files:**
- `/PROGRESS.md` - Mark features as complete
- `/specs/property-management/tasks.md` - Check off completed frontend tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Integration Points**

### **Existing Backend API**
- **14 Endpoints Ready** - Full CRUD, search, import/export APIs available
- **Property Groups** - Management API for property organization
- **Geocoding** - Address validation and mapping coordinates
- **Audit Logging** - Property change tracking

### **Frontend Requirements**
- **React Components** - Build reusable property management components
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach for property managers in the field
- **State Management** - Handle property data and user interactions
- **File Upload** - For property photos and document import

### **Dependencies**
- **User Authentication** - Property managers need to be logged in
