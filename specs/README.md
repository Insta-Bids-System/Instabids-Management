# InstaBids Feature Specifications

## 🏗️ Feature Architecture Overview

This directory contains 7 distinct feature specifications for the InstaBids marketplace platform. Each feature is designed as an independent module with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies.

## 📁 Feature Specifications

### ✅ **Completed Features**
- **user-authentication** - JWT-based auth system with Supabase integration
- **property-management** - Property CRUD, groups, and geocoding

### 🚧 **Ready to Build**
- **project-creation** - <2min project creation with auto-contractor matching
- **contractor-onboarding** - Verification workflow and profile completion
- **quote-submission** - Multi-format quote collection (PDF, email, photo, web form)
- **smartscope-ai** - OpenAI Vision project analysis and scope extraction
- **admin-dashboard** - Analytics, reporting, and system monitoring

## ⚡ Parallel Development Strategy

### 🟢 **Phase 1: Maximum Parallelism (3 Features)**
These can be built simultaneously by different development teams:

```
Feature A: smartscope-ai
├── 100% independent AI service
├── OpenAI Vision integration
├── Can be split into parallel submodules:
│   ├── Photo Analysis Pipeline (image preprocessing, AI requests)
│   ├── Domain Configuration (analysis categories, prompting)
│   ├── Scope Enhancement (human review UI, learning feedback)
│   └── Cross-cutting safeguards (accuracy, security, cost tracking)
└── No dependencies on other features

Feature B: admin-dashboard  
├── Read-only analytics interface
├── Database queries only
└── No business logic conflicts

Feature C: quote-submission
├── Independent upload/processing system
├── File handling and standardization
└── Minimal dependencies (needs projects to exist)
```

### 🟡 **Phase 2: Core Business Logic (2 Features)**
Sequential build required due to shared components:

```
Feature D: project-creation (Build First)
├── Creates contractor matching algorithm foundation
├── Builds invitation system backbone
└── Establishes project workflow patterns

Feature E: contractor-onboarding (Build Second)
├── ⚠️  INTEGRATION PENDING: May integrate with external contractor acquisition system
├── Uses project-creation's matching logic
├── Integrates with invitation system
└── Extends contractor verification workflow
```

## ⚠️ Key Integration Points

### **Shared Services**
- **Contractor Matching Algorithm** - Created in project-creation, used by contractor-onboarding
- **File Upload Service** - Shared by project-creation, quote-submission, contractor-onboarding
- **Notification System** - Used across all features for real-time updates

### **External System Integrations**
- **External Contractor Acquisition System** - Separate system that actively recruits contractors via web search, email, phone outreach. May impact contractor-onboarding implementation approach.
- **Existing Campaign Logic** - Pre-built logic in another system that determines contractor requirements based on project needs

### **Database Dependencies**
All features share the marketplace database schema (21 tables):
- Core tables: `projects`, `contractors`, `quotes`, `invitations`
- Supporting tables: `smartscope_analyses`, `project_media`, `awards`

## 🚀 Development Timeline

### **Week 1-2: Parallel Development**
```bash
Team A: SmartScope AI (24 tasks)
Team B: Admin Dashboard (estimated 30 tasks)  
Team C: Quote Submission (60+ tasks)
```

### **Week 3-4: Core Platform**
```bash
Team D: Project Creation (96 tasks) - Start immediately
Team E: Contractor Onboarding (75 tasks) - Start after matching algorithm complete
```

## 📊 Feature Complexity Matrix

- Database: All tables (read-only queries)

### **Quote Submission**
- Backend: File processing + AI standardization
- Frontend: Multi-format upload interface
- Database: `quotes`, `quote_line_items` tables

### **Project Creation**
- Backend: Project CRUD + contractor matching
- Frontend: Project wizard + virtual walk-through
- Database: `projects`, `project_media`, `invitations`

### **Contractor Onboarding**
- Backend: Verification workflow + profile management
- Frontend: Multi-step onboarding wizard
- Database: `contractors`, `contractor_credentials`, `contractor_portfolio`

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### **For Parallel Development:**
1. Use feature branches: `feature/smartscope-ai`, `feature/admin-dashboard`
2. Mock shared services initially, integrate later
3. Use TypeScript interfaces for cross-feature contracts
4. Test each feature independently before integration

### **Integration Phase:**
1. Merge features in dependency order
2. Run full integration tests
3. Update shared service implementations
4. Validate end-to-end user journeys
