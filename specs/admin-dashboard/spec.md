# Feature Specification: Admin Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-admin-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-01-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive admin dashboard for InstaBids platform oversight including projects, bids, contractors, and system metrics"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an InstaBids administrator, I need a centralized dashboard where I can monitor all platform activity, identify issues quickly, and take action on problematic accounts or projects without switching between multiple systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated admin, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I see real-time metrics for active projects, pending bids, and online users
2. **Given** I see a suspicious bid pattern, **When** I click on the bid details, **Then** I can view full bid history and contractor information
3. **Given** I identify a problematic user, **When** I select administrative action, **Then** I can suspend, warn, or modify their account with an audit trail

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metrics data is unavailable? → Show cached data with "last updated" timestamp
- How does system handle concurrent admin actions? → Optimistic locking with conflict resolution
- What if an admin's session expires during an action? → Save draft state, require re-authentication

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time counts of active projects, pending bids, and registered users
- **FR-002**: System MUST show top 10 contractors by revenue, bid success rate, and customer rating
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide search functionality for projects, users, and bids with filters
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all admin actions with timestamp, admin ID, and affected entities
- **FR-005**: System MUST refresh metrics every [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: refresh interval not specified - 30s, 60s, real-time?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST support export of displayed data to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export format not specified - CSV, PDF, Excel?]
- **FR-007**: Administrators MUST have role-based permissions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: admin hierarchy not specified - super admin, regular admin, viewer?]

### Key Entities
- **AdminUser**: Represents administrative account with permissions, last login, action history
- **DashboardMetric**: Represents a trackable metric with current value, trend, and threshold alerts
- **AuditLog**: Represents admin action with timestamp, actor, action type, target entity, and change details
