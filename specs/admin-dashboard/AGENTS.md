Build a comprehensive analytics and monitoring dashboard for InstaBids platform administrators to track system performance, user engagement, and business metrics.

### **Key Features to Build**
1. **System Overview** - High-level platform health and activity metrics
2. **User Analytics** - Property manager and contractor growth and engagement
3. **Project Metrics** - Project creation, completion, and success rates
4. **Financial Dashboard** - Quote volumes, contract values, and revenue tracking
5. **Performance Monitoring** - AI accuracy, response times, system health
6. **Reporting Tools** - Exportable reports and data visualization

### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive dashboard with all key business metrics
- ‚úÖ Real-time data visualization and analytics
- ‚úÖ User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation
- ‚úÖ Exportable reports and data insights
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and alerting
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control for admin users

## üîß **Development Guidelines**

### **File Structure**
```
src/api/admin/                     # Backend analytics API endpoints
src/components/admin-dashboard/    # Frontend dashboard components
src/components/charts/             # Reusable chart components
src/services/analytics/            # Data processing and aggregation
tests/admin-dashboard/             # Test files
```

### **Database Operations**
- **ALWAYS** use Supabase MCP tools for database work
- **READ-ONLY** operations only - no data modification
- **NEVER** hardcode database credentials
- **OPTIMIZE** queries for performance with large datasets

### **Git Workflow**
```bash
# Work on feature branch
git checkout -b feature/admin-dashboard

# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
git commit -m "feat: implement project metrics dashboard with charts"

# Update progress tracking
# Edit /PROGRESS.md after completing major milestones
```

### **Progress Tracking**
**ALWAYS update these files:**
- `/PROGRESS.md` - Mark features as complete
- Create `/specs/admin-dashboard/tasks.md` - Track your implementation tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Integration Points**

### **Data Sources**
- **All Database Tables** - Read-only access to complete platform data
- **Real-time Updates** - Consider WebSocket integration for live data
- **Historical Trends** - Time-series analysis of platform growth

### **Visualization Libraries**
- **Chart.js** or **D3.js** - For interactive data visualization
- **React Dashboard Libraries** - For layout and components
- **Export Tools** - PDF/Excel export functionality
