# InstaBids-Management: Codex Agent Instructions

## üéØ Project Context
**Marketplace Platform**: Property managers create maintenance projects, contractors submit quotes
**Database**: 21 tables in Supabase supporting complete marketplace workflow
**Status**: Database complete, 2 features done, 5 features ready for parallel development

## üóÑÔ∏è Required Database Connection

**Supabase Configuration:**
```yaml
Project ID: lmbpvkfcfhdfaihigfdu
URL: https://lmbpvkfcfhdfaihigfdu.supabase.co
Environment: Development
```

**ALWAYS use these tools for database operations:**
- `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` - Run SQL queries (project_id: lmbpvkfcfhdfaihigfdu)
- `mcp__supabase__list_tables` - Check existing tables
- `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` - Only if new tables needed (rare)

**NEVER:**
- Hardcode database credentials
- Use raw SQL without MCP tools
- Modify existing table schemas without approval

## üìã Required Reading (Read in Order)

### **Before Starting Any Feature:**
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Complete project context and development guidelines
2. `/README.md` - Marketplace vision and technical overview
3. `/PROGRESS.md` - Current status and what's already built
4. `/specs/README.md` - Parallel development strategy and conflicts
5. `/migrations/applied.md` - Database migration status and history

### **For Your Specific Feature:**
6. `/specs/[your-feature]/AGENTS.md` - Feature-specific instructions (START HERE)
7. `/specs/[your-feature]/spec.md` - Complete feature requirements
8. `/specs/[your-feature]/plan.md` - Technical implementation plan (if exists)
9. `/specs/[your-feature]/tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown

## üîß Development Rules

### **File Structure Standards**
```
src/api/[feature]/                 # Backend API endpoints
src/components/[feature]/          # Frontend React components
src/services/[feature]/            # Business logic and integrations
tests/[feature]/                   # Test files
```

### **Git Workflow (MANDATORY)**
```bash
# Always work on feature branches
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
git commit -m "feat: implement [specific functionality]"
git commit -m "test: add [test description]"
git commit -m "fix: resolve [issue description]"

# Update progress tracking files
# Edit /PROGRESS.md after major milestones
```

### **Database Operations**
- **TEST EVERYTHING**: Verify all database operations with real data
- **READ-ONLY FIRST**: Test queries before any modifications
- **UPDATE TRACKING**: Update `/migrations/applied.md` if you create new tables

### **Code Standards**
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing for all new code
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **API**: Follow RESTful conventions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API responses

## üß™ Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

### **Before Claiming Feature Complete:**
1. **Unit Tests**: Test all functions individually
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows end-to-end
3. **Database Tests**: Verify all CRUD operations with real data
4. **API Tests**: Test all endpoints with various inputs
5. **Frontend Tests**: Validate UI components and user flows

### **Validation Commands**
```bash
# Run tests (if test framework exists)
npm test

# Check types (if TypeScript)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Lint code (if linter exists)
npm run lint

# Test database connection
# Use mcp__supabase__list_tables to verify connection
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When to STOP and Ask Questions

**STOP and ask before:**
- Modifying any existing database schema
- Making major architectural decisions
- Integrating with external systems (especially contractor acquisition)
- Adding new dependencies or services
- Changing authentication or organization logic

**Proceed independently with:**
- Building features per existing specifications
- Creating UI components per designs
- Implementing business logic per requirements
- Writing tests and documentation
- Optimizing performance

## üîÑ Progress Tracking (REQUIRED)

### **ALWAYS Update These Files:**
- `/PROGRESS.md` - Mark features and milestones as complete
- `/specs/[your-feature]/tasks.md` - Check off completed tasks
- `/migrations/applied.md` - If you create new database tables

### **Commit Messages Must Include:**
- What functionality was implemented
- What was tested and verified
- Any issues encountered and resolved

## üöÄ Integration Points

### **Shared Services (coordinate if building):**
- **Contractor Matching Algorithm** - Used by project-creation and contractor-onboarding
- **File Upload Service** - Used by multiple features for photos/documents
- **Notification System** - Cross-feature communication

### **External Systems (ask before integrating):**
- **External Contractor Acquisition System** - Recruits contractors via web search/email
- **OpenAI Vision API** - For SmartScope AI photo analysis
- **Email Processing** - For quote submission via email

## üìä Success Criteria

### **Feature Complete Means:**
‚úÖ All tasks in your feature's `tasks.md` completed
‚úÖ All database operations tested with real data  
‚úÖ All API endpoints functional and tested
‚úÖ Frontend components working and responsive
‚úÖ Integration with dependent features verified
‚úÖ Error handling comprehensive
‚úÖ Progress tracking files updated
‚úÖ Code follows project conventions

### **Ready for Production Means:**
‚úÖ Test coverage adequate for feature complexity
‚úÖ Performance optimized (API responses < 500ms)
‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness verified
‚úÖ Security validation passed
‚úÖ Documentation complete

## üéØ Current Feature Status

### **‚úÖ Complete (85-80%):**
- `user-authentication` - Needs testing and documentation
- `property-management` - Needs frontend UI components

### **üöß Ready for Development:**
- `project-creation` - 96 tasks, contractor matching, auto-invitations
- `contractor-onboarding` - 75 tasks, verification workflow
- `quote-submission` - 60+ tasks, multi-format AI processing  
- `smartscope-ai` - 24 tasks, OpenAI Vision integration
- `admin-dashboard` - Analytics and reporting interface
